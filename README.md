# tic_tac_toe_game

A new Flutter project.

Intro about tic-tac-toe game : 

Tic-tac-toe (or Noughts and crosses, Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

In this project we are creating tic-tac-toe game board so user can play that game without 
using paper and pencil.

About this project :
